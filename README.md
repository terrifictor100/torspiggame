# torspiggame
My very first coded game:

- The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
- In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his round score
- BUT, if the player rolls a 1, all his round score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his round score gets added to his final score. After that, it's the next player's turn
- The first player to reach 100 points on their final score wins the game

I learnt how to code this game through a JS Course on Udemy - but after I had been through the tutorial, I deleted all the code, started again and re-created the game myself.
